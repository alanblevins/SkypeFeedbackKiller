Code sample for http://www.slagheap.info/2015/10/auto-killing-skype-call-quality.html

You can run and compile kill_skype_feedback.au3 using [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/)

I also included a compiled binary built for Windows 10 x64. No idea if it will work for you, but you're welcome to try.
